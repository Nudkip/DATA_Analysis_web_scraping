              "  'For the first time, we had an AI system that could write text so humanlike that readers consistently couldn’t tell that it was AI-generated. But more than that, GPT-3 could also translate between languages, write code, answer questions, and much more.',\n",
              "  'And it did all thing thanks simply to its scale. GPT-3 was a much larger model, featuring more parameters than any transformer ever developed before. And it was trained using an appropriately massive amount of processing power, and a huge dataset which amounted to essentially all the text on the internet at the time.',\n",
              "  'The idea that simply by scaling a simple transformer architecture — an architecture which had by then already been around for three years! — we could achieve a significant level of general intelligence and human-like text generation capability came as a shock to just about everyone. But it had enormous consequences: by building GPT-3 and announcing it to the world in such a public fashion, OpenAI drew the world’s attention to the AI scaling phenomenon.',\n",
              "  'Since then, dozens of other companies have put forward their own superscaled AI models with increasingly astonishing capabilities. Google AI, DeepMind, Mircosoft, NVIDIA, Cohere, AI21Labs, and many more Western groups have entered the fray. And Chinese labs at Huawei, Inspur, the Beijing Academy of AI, and Tsinghua University have been close to the frontier of AI scaling, too — despite export controls that make it harder for them to get their hands on the processing power that’s so critical to scaling AI.',\n",
              "  'The one-fringe AI scaling strategy that OpenAI first doubled down on in 2020 is now becoming the de facto consensus approach by world-leading labs everywhere. And although the specific recipe OpenAI proposed with GPT-3 has since been shown to be sub-optimal (as DeepMind’s Chinchilla showed), the fact remains: we now have a reliable way of pumping in more scale — more data, more processing power, and larger models — and getting more intelligence and more capabilities out of our AI systems.',\n",
              "  'And there’s no end in sight: as the dizzying pace of AI progress in the last few months has shown, scaling just seems to keep paying dividends. Google’s Minerva model can solve undergraduate-level math problems. DeepMind’s Flamingo — and many other scaled multi-modal models since — are showing that scaling makes it possible for AI to process and output text, image, video, and other data shockingly well. Once the stuff of scifi fantasy, text-to-image, text-to-video, and really, text-to-anything models are now mundane everyday realities.',\n",

              "  'This immediately implies that one of the most valuable skills of the coming AI era will be the ability to translate new technical developments into nontechnical language. As progress in AI accelerates, the gap between actual AI and perceived AI capabilities will get larger, and an organization’s ability to compete will become bottlenecked by the rate at which it can recognize and leverage the latest AI tooling. People who can live at the boundary between the technical world of AI scaling and the nontechnical world of business strategy are going to become some of the most prized assets in every organization.',\n",
